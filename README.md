# AMAZE3D-Localization

https://chaymakes.com/roku

These resources are used for the localization of the game. 

Currently included languages: (English, Spanish, Portuguese). 
I used a automated translation tool  to create "International Spanish" and "Portuguese", and
the translation may not be totally correct.

I'm sharing the localization data of the game. So that anyone that speaks one of these 
languages can check/correct my version, or add a new folder for the other languages.

Folder structure: 

      - en_GB: UK English
      
      - pt_BR: Brazilian Portuguese
      
      - es_ES: International Spanish
      
      - es_MX: International Spanish
      
      - fr_CA: Canadian French
      
      - de_DE: German
      
      - it_IT: Italian



Thanks
