These resources are used for the localization of the game. 

Currently included languages: (English, Spanish, Portuguese). 
I used a automated translation tool to create "International Spanish" and "Portuguese", but
I can tell that some of the translation is not totally correct. 

I'm sharing the localization data of the game. So that anyone that speaks one of these 
languages can check/correct my version, or add a new folder for the other languages.

Folder structure: 

      - en_GB: UK English
      
      - pt_BR: Brazilian Portuguese
      
      - es_ES: International Spanish
      
      - es_MX: International Spanish
      
      - fr_CA: Canadian French
      
      - de_DE: German
      
      - it_IT: Italian



Thanks
